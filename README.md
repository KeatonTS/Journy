# Journy
A note taking/journalling app designed to keep your day in focus. It merges the act of journaling and planning to keep productivity in the forefront.
3 fields are presented "Today I", "Tomorrow, I" and "Anything else?". The expectation is to highlight what you've done today, what you plan on doing tomorrow,
and a blurb about how your day went, any honorable mentions, or thoughts you may want to jot down. Over time, the app creates a visual trial of what you've done,
and how your goals look and change over time
