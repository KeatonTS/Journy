# Journy
Journy is a note taking/journaling app designed to keep your day in focus for what you did and/or want to do today and tomorrow. It merges the act of journaling and planning (Also the words Journey and Journal)
to keep productivity in the forefront. 3 fields are presented "Today I", "Tomorrow, I" and "Anything else?". The expectation is to highlight what you've done or will do today, what you plan on doing tomorrow,
and a blurb about how your day went, any honorable mentions, or thoughts you may want to jot down. Over time, the app creates a visual trail of what you've done, and how your goals look and change over time, 
i.e, a Journey.

This app started off as a personal idea I had when trying to come up with an idea for an app after learning python. While I had to put it on the back burner, it resurfaced as a potential project for a hackathon.
This app was made from the ground up in collaboration by myself, who worked on both the front and back-end development and design, and 3 other programmers, Timothy Price (Front-End Dev), James Kim (Front-End Dev), and Tim Butts (Back-End Dev) 
which initially began on October 28th 2023.
